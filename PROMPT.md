Build me a social media web application called Orbit. I want something that feels like a real product, not a tutorial project. Think Twitter meets Instagram with built-in messaging, all wrapped in a clean modern interface that would look at home in any startup's portfolio.

The design should feel premium but not cold. Use soft grays and whites for light mode, and go with true black for dark mode because it looks gorgeous on modern screens. The accent color is a warm orange that fades into amber, but don't overuse it. Save it for buttons that matter, active states, and the logo. Everything should have friendly rounded corners, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions. Use the Urbanist font throughout. Hide the scrollbars but keep things scrollable because visible scrollbars just look dated now.

The layout follows a classic three-column structure. A fixed header at the top with the Orbit logo on the left, which is just a bold O in an orange gradient square followed by the wordmark. On the right side of the header put the user's avatar, a button for connections, and a theme toggle that smoothly switches between a sun and moon icon. Below the header, the left sidebar shows a profile card with the user's photo, name, job title, and their follower stats. Add a little analytics widget with a simple bar chart showing weekly engagement, then the main navigation with Home, Discover, Chats, and Notifications. The center column is where everything happens, scrolling independently from the sidebars. The right sidebar just shows who's currently online so you can quickly start a conversation with them. On tablets, hide the right sidebar. On phones, collapse everything into a slide-out drawer that appears when you tap the logo.

The home feed is the heart of the app. Put a composer at the top where users can write posts and attach multiple images. The textarea should grow as you type and the share button should only enable once there's actual content. Below that, show post cards in a vertical feed. Each card has the author's avatar and info, the post text, any images in a nice grid layout, and action buttons for liking, commenting, and sharing. When you tap the comment button, the comments section should slide open smoothly showing existing comments and letting you add your own. Likes should feel instant, toggling the heart to red immediately without waiting for anything.

The discover section is for exploring content. Show a header that says Discover with a subtitle about finding trending stuff, then a row of filter pills you can scroll horizontally to pick categories like Technology, Design, Photography, Travel, and so on. Feature a couple of popular posts in larger cards at the top, then lay out the rest in a grid of smaller cards. When you tap any card, open it in a theater mode modal with the image large on one side and all the details and comments on the other. On phones this stacks vertically. Include a close button and let people click the backdrop to dismiss it.

The messaging section needs a split view with conversations listed on the left and the active chat on the right. Each conversation row shows the person's avatar with a green dot if they're online, their name, a preview of the last message, and an unread badge if needed. The chat area has their info at the top with a menu to clear the conversation, then the messages themselves with yours on the right in orange bubbles and theirs on the left in gray. Support sending images that display inline in the bubbles. Here's the fun part: when someone sends a message, wait a moment, show a typing indicator, and have the other person send back a contextual reply. It makes the demo feel alive. On phones, only show one panel at a time with a back button to return to the conversation list.

Notifications are straightforward. List them vertically with each one showing who triggered it, a little icon badge indicating what type it is like a heart for likes or a speech bubble for comments, the message itself, and when it happened. Unread ones should have a subtle orange tint and a small dot. Mark everything read when someone views this tab.

The connections screen has two sections. First show all existing friends with their online status. Then show suggested people with mutual connection counts and a connect button that changes to sent after you tap it.

The profile screen opens with a cover photo banner and the user's avatar overlapping the edge of it. Show their name, handle, job, location, and bio. Display their stats for posts, followers, and following. Include edit and share buttons where share copies the profile link and shows a little toast confirmation. Below that, add tabs for switching between their posts grid and saved items. The posts appear as square thumbnails you can tap to see the full image and comments.

Everything needs to animate nicely. Cards should fade in with a slight upward movement when they appear. Buttons should have subtle scale effects on hover and tap. Modals should fade and scale in smoothly. The mobile drawer should slide from the left with a spring feel. Keep it tasteful though, animations should enhance the experience not distract from it.

Make sure the dark mode is rock solid. Check for a saved preference in localStorage first, fall back to the system setting if there isn't one, and apply the right theme before anything renders so there's never a flash of the wrong colors. When people toggle the theme, transition smoothly between them.

On mobile, make sure touch targets are big enough to tap comfortably, at least 44 pixels. Set input font sizes to 16 pixels so iOS doesn't zoom in when you focus them. Handle the safe areas on phones with notches.

Use semantic HTML and add proper accessibility labels to buttons that only have icons. Make sure you can navigate everything with a keyboard and that focus states are visible.

For images, always have a fallback ready in case something fails to load. Wrap the app in an error boundary so a crash in one component doesn't take down the whole page.

Build this with React and Vite. Use Tailwind for styling and Framer Motion for animations. Pull icons from Lucide. Make sure you include every dependency the code actually uses so when someone runs npm install and npm run dev it just works on the first try without any missing module errors. That's important, nothing kills confidence in a codebase faster than a broken first run.

Fill the app with realistic mock data. Create users with real-looking names and photos from Unsplash. Write posts that sound like things people would actually share. Populate conversations with back-and-forth messages that feel natural. Generate varied notifications. The app should feel lived-in when you open it, not empty.

The goal is a portfolio piece that shows you can build something polished from end to end. Every detail should feel considered. No placeholder text, no half-finished features, no janky interactions. Someone should be able to look at this and think yeah, that could ship.
