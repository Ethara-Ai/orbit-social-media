I want a social media dashboard called "Orbit" built in React with JavaScript, using a modular component-based architecture with Vite and Tailwind CSS. It should show my personal profile and activity from my network across multiple tabs: Feed, Explore, Messages, and Notifications. There should be an interactive sidebar on the left with navigation and friend lists that can expand, a center feed with animated card-style posts using Framer Motion, and a right panel showing active online friends and suggested connections. It needs to have real-time notification badges that auto-generate, pop-up toasts, and a smart messaging system with auto-responses, all without reloading the page. The design should use orange as the main color with amber gradients, and have a modern, clean card-based style with smooth hover animations.
