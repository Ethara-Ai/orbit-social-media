Build a social networking dashboard named Orbit using React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, and Framer Motion. Structure the codebase with feature-based folder organization and manage state through six domain-specific React Context providers (User, Feed, Messages, Notifications, Explore, UI), each exposing methods via custom hooks to avoid prop drilling.

Extract business logic into a dedicated service layer (postService, messageService, conversationService, notificationService) keeping UI components lightweight. Implement reusable hooks for click-outside detection, debouncing, localStorage persistence, media queries, and scroll handling. Use ErrorBoundary components to isolate failures.

Design the interface with: a collapsible left sidebar showing user profile, navigation, analytics, and friends list; a main content area with six tab views (Home feed, Discover/Explore, Messages, Notifications, Connections, Profile); and a right sidebar displaying online contacts and suggested users. The Home feed supports post creation with likes, comments, and shares. Discover includes category filtering, featured posts, and a theater mode for immersive viewing. Messages features smart contextual auto-responses, typing indicators, and image attachments. Notifications auto-generates alerts every 60 seconds simulating social interactions.

Style with an orange/amber color scheme, card-based layouts, Framer Motion animations, custom scrollbars, and responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Colocate tests with components using Vitest and React Testing Library. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment to AWS S3.

Seed with mock data including user profiles, friends with availability states, posts with comments, chat conversations, notifications, and suggested users so the app feels complete on first load.
