Take on the role of a Senior Frontend Architect to build a fully functional social networking dashboard named Orbit from scratch using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for smooth transitions. Structure the codebase using a feature-based folder organization where application state is managed through multiple React Context providers—one each for User information, Feed content, Messaging, Notifications, Discovery features, and interface state—with each context exposing well-defined methods and data accessors via custom hooks. Create a dedicated service layer containing all business logic for handling posts, processing messages, managing conversations, and generating notifications, ensuring that UI components remain lightweight and concerned only with rendering. Integrate localStorage persistence through a reusable hook so that every user action survives page reloads and session restarts, and enforce code quality through PropTypes definitions, thorough JSDoc comments describing how data moves through the system, and Error Boundary components that isolate failures within individual features without bringing down the entire application.

Design the interface with a left navigation panel that can collapse and includes a friends list with expand functionality, alongside a main content region containing four distinct views—a Home feed where users compose posts and engage through likes, comments, and shares; a Discover section for exploring content filtered by category with an immersive full-screen viewing mode; a Messaging area featuring intelligent automated responses that adapt to conversation context, visual typing indicators, and the ability to attach images; and a Notifications center that automatically generates new alerts every minute simulating various social interactions like follows, mentions, and connection requests while maintaining live unread counts. Add a companion panel on the right showing currently online contacts and recommended people to follow based on shared connections. Style everything with an orange and amber color scheme, clean card-based components with animated hover effects, customized scrollbar aesthetics, and a polished loading experience featuring an animated logo. Seed the application with rich sample data encompassing a logged-in user, numerous friends displaying different availability states, various posts spanning multiple topics with associated comments, ongoing chat threads containing believable exchanges, and assorted notifications ensuring the platform appears vibrant and complete from the moment it loads.
